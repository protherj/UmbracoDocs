## Release History

This section contains the release notes for Umbraco Workflow 14 including all changes for this version.

### [14.1.0](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Arelease%2F14.1.0) (October 23 2024 )
* Adds scheduled content locking feature. Documents can be made readonly until the scheduled release date passes, to ensure approved content is not modified without workflow approval. [#84](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues/84)
* Adds support for readonly mode when a document is pending workflow approval. Along with the scheduled content lock, this feature requires Umbraco 14.3.0, which is now the minumum version dependency for Umbraco Workflow v14.
* Adds support for content segments. Segment names are displayed when requesting approval and in workflow history [#60](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues/60)
* Adds support for Arabic.
* Improves UI in workflow detail overlay. Reduces the number of elements and shifts appropriate data points into tag elements.
* Adds email queue for thread-safe email notifications. Emails are now processed in the hosted service, via a first-in first-out queue.
