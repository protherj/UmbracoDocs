## Release History

This section contains the release notes for Umbraco Workflow 13 including all changes for this version.

### [13.3.0](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Arelease%2F13.3.0) (October 23 2024 )
* Adds scheduled content locking feature. Documents can be made readonly until the scheduled release date passes, to ensure approved content is not modified without workflow approval. [#84](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues/84)
* Adds support for content segments. Segment names are displayed when requesting approval and in workflow history [#60](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues/60)
* Adds support for Arabic.
* Improves UI in workflow detail overlay. Reduces the number of elements and shifts appropriate data points into tag elements.
* Adds email queue for thread-safe email notifications. Emails are now processed in the hosted service, via a first-in first-out queue. This resolves a reported issue where sending large numbers of emails could result in data reader errors. [#85](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues/85)

### [13.2.1](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Arelease%2F13.2.1) (October 3 2024)

* Fixes an issue where scheduled workflows did not apply the release/expire date if the content node was already scheduled [#81](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues/80)
* Ensure converting integers to strings uses the invariant culture to avoid unexpected formatting

### [13.2.0](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Arelease%2F13.2.0) (September 12 2024)

* **BREAKING CHANGE** resolving [#77](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues/77) includes removing the `DateTimeSettings` class.
