Alternatively, Umbraco uMS can be installed via the console on your operating machine.

{% endhint %}

## Next steps

![Engage section in the Umbraco Backoffice.](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

When you have installed the Umbraco uMS, build or restart your website, and the **Marketing** section will appear in the backoffice, as shown above.

The next step is to [configure a license](../../../installing-umarketingsuite/licensing/).

It is recommended to consider the information detailed in the section below, to get the best out of Umbraco uMS.

### Umbraco Forms

If you have installed **Umbraco Forms** as well and want to automatically track submissions of Umbraco Forms. Please install the package [uMarketingSuite.UmbracoForms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/uMarketingSuite.UmbracoForms) via NuGet as well using your preferred approach as above.

PUT THE FOLLOWING TWO INTO TABS

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Visual Studio Package Manager" %}
```
PM> install package uMarketingSuite.UmbracoForms
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Console" %}
```console
dotnet add package uMarketingSuite.UmbracoForms
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Clientside tracking

To capture events that happen on the clientside (frontend) of your website, you need to add the [clientside tracking script](../../../analytics/clientside-events-and-additional-javascript-files/additional-measurements-with-our-ums-analytics-scripts/). This is done by including the following snippet on all of your pages.

```html
<script src="/Assets/uMarketingSuite/Scripts/uMarketingSuite.analytics.js"></script>
```

### Cockpit

Cockpit is a tool to help with testing segments and diagnose the data uMarkertingSuite collects. It can be viewed on the frontend of your website, only if you are logged into Umbraco as well.

Install cockpit on your website by adding the following Razor Partial View in your templates in Umbraco before the closing `</body>` tag

```html
@Html.Partial("uMarketingSuite/Cockpit")</body>
```

Learn more [what Cockpit is and how you can use](../../../installing-umarketingsuite/cockpit/) it.

### Optional Extras

Here are some optional extras you can do to improve your experience with uMS.

* Add a [Google Analytics bridging script](../../../analytics/clientside-events-and-additional-javascript-files/bridging-library-for-google-analytics/) that automatically sends events that you send to Google Analytics, to uMS as well.

```html
<script src="~/Assets/uMarketingSuite/Scripts/uMarketingSuite.analytics.ga4-bridge.min.js"></script>
```

* Add the [Google Analytics blocker detection script](../../../analytics/clientside-events-and-additional-javascript-files/google-analytics-blocker-detection/). This gives you insights in which page traffic the uMS will track, and Google Analytics will not track.

```html
<script src="/Assets/uMarketingSuite/Scripts/uMarketingSuite.analytics.blockerdetection.js"></script>
```

### Cookie consent

If you need to influence the default [uMS cookie](../../../the-umarketingsuite-broad-overview/the-umarketingsuite-cookie/) behaviour please go [here](../../../security-privacy/gdpr/). Or go to an example [implementation using Cookiebot](../../../security-privacy/gdpr/how-to-become-gdpr-compliant-using-cookiebot/) which can be used as an example for other cookie consent providers.\\

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you [change the default cookie behaviour](../../../the-umarketingsuite-broad-overview/the-umarketingsuite-cookie/module-permissions/) make sure to perform a **client side reload of the initial page after cookie consent**. If this is not done, visitor referrer and/or campaigns will not be tracked.
{% endhint %}

### Load balancing and CM / CD environments

Are you using a load-balanced setup or separate CM and CD environments? Please check our documentation about this topic [here](../../../installing-umarketingsuite/loadbalancing-and-cm-cd-environment/).
