# Split URL Test

Split URL testing in Umbraco Engage helps you compare different versions of a page.

You create different versions of a page. Each version can have different designs, text, or buttons based on the possibilities that have been setup in Umbraco.

When you set up the A/B test, you can send 50% of visitors to page A and 50% to page B. This way, you can see which page helps achieve the goal of the test better.

The split URL test is a great way to test different checkout workflows, for example.
