# Content Apps

In the content section of Umbraco you'll see all Umbraco nodes and most of them will relate to a specific page in your website. If you have installed the Umbraco Engage each Umbraco node will have three extra Content Apps.&#x20;

## Analytics

If you navigate to a node you will see the Analytics content app. If you open the Content App the Analytics data of this specific node is loaded.

## A/B Testing

The A/B testing content app will allow you to test your Umbraco node within the splitview functionality. Every document type can be A/B tested:

## Personalization

The personalization content app allows you to score this specific page on the customer journey & persona (if you want to implicit score your content). It also allows you to setup personalized variants of each node.

## Managing the access to content apps

In the settings of the Engage-section you can manage on which document types these content apps are displayed, and which Umbraco user groups have access to these content apps. They can be easily managed per document type and per user group
