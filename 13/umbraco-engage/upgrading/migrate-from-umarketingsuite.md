# Migrate from uMarketingSuite

{% hint style="info" %}
This document is a work in progress.

The final version will be available with the release of Umbraco Engage.
{% endhint %}

### **General upgrade steps from uMarketingSuite to Umbraco Engage**

* Backup database from production environment and restore locally
* Apply the databases changes as outlined below
  * The database changes should be executed in < 10 sec. because we are using [sp\_rename](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-rename-transact-sql)
* Apply the code changes as outlined below in the detailed steps
* Test locally&#x20;
* Apply the database changes and the new code to each environment (make sure to create backups of code and database!)

### **Default scripts**

Make sure to change the reference to the client side analytics scripts to:

```
<script src="~/Assets/Umbraco.Engage/Scripts/umbracoEngage.analytics.js"></script>
<script src="~/Assets/Umbraco.Engage/Scripts/umbracoEngage.analytics.ga-bridge.js"></script>
<script src="~/Assets/Umbraco.Engage/Scripts/umbracoEngage.analytics.blockerdetection.js"></script>
```

See the detailed steps and instructions here \<link to guide of Corné below>

### **Implemented custom javascript events?**&#x20;

Make sure to change all custom events from **ums** to **umbEngage**

`ums("send", "event", "<Category name>", "<Action>", "<Label>")`&#x20;

is now:

`umbEngage("send", "event", "<Category name>", "<Action>", "<Label>")`

### **Any custom code?**

Did you build your own segments, added custom goal triggering etc. then have a close look at which namespaces and classes have been changed here \<link to the C# Class changes section>.



### **Any custom firewall changes?**

If the /umbraco/umarketingsuite/ path was previously allowed, this needs to change to /umbraco/engage/

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to migrating a default uMarketingSuite solution to Umbraco Engage.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Upgrade to the latest version of uMarketingSuite before continuing with the migration.

You can upgrade your installation by installing the [latest version](https://www.nuget.org/packages/uMarketingSuite/) on top of the existing one.
{% endhint %}

You can find additional information on migrating the add-on packages for UmbracoForms, Commerce & Headless in the [Further Migrations section](./#further-migrations) of this article.

## Key changes

Before outlining the exact steps, there are a few key changes to be aware of.

These changes will dictate the steps to take in the process of migrating to Umbraco Engage.

Before getting started, it is worth noting that going from uMarketingSuite to Umbraco Engage is not a direct upgrade. 
The changes are significant enough that it is more akin to a migration.

</details>

## Step 1: Prerequisites Check

In this first step, you need to check the Database state to see if the existing data can be migrated to Umbraco Engage.

{% hint style="info" %}
Are you using separate databases for uMarketingSuite and Umbraco? In that case, run the first group of checks on the Umbraco database and the second group of checks on the uMarketingSuite database.
{% endhint %}

1. Execute the prerequisites check using the following query:
```LINK TO Step-1-Prerequisites.sql file```
2. Verify that uMarketingSuite & uMarketingSuite addon version checks return the expected results.
3. Verify that the uMarketingSuite table integrity check returns the expected results.

The result should look like this:
```
---Running Version Pre-Requisite Checks for uMarketingSuite to Umbraco Engage Migration---
✔️ Detected uMarketingSuite version 2.6.1 or higher
✔️ Detected uMarketingSuite.UmbracoCommerce version 2.0.0 or higher
✔️ Detected uMarketingSuite.UmbracoForms version 2.0.0 or higher
---Running Integrity Pre-Requisite Checks for uMarketingSuite to Umbraco Engage Migration---
✔️ The [uMarketingSuiteAnalyticsGoalCompletion] table is in a valid state to be upgraded.
✔️ The [uMarketingSuiteAnalyticsPageEvent] table is in a valid state to be upgraded.
---Finished running Pre-Requisite Checks. Please verify if all 5 checks succeeded before proceeding---
```
If any of these checks return a failure, please resolve the issue before proceeding with the migration.

## Step 2: Replace dependencies

In this second step, you will replace all existing uMarketingSuite dependencies with Umbraco Engage dependencies.

1. (If applicable) Take a backup of any custom implementation of uMarketingSuite-specific files you want to reuse.

2. Remove any installed uMarketingSuite packages (including UmbracoForms, Commerce, and Headless) from your project:

```bash
dotnet remove package uMarketingSuite
dotnet remove package uMarketingSuite.Headless
dotnet remove package uMarketingSuite.UmbracoForms
dotnet remove package uMarketingSuite.Commerce
```

3. Delete the `App_Plugins\*` folder for uMarketingSuite (and if applicable `uMarketingSuite.UmbracoForms`):

```bash
rmdir /s App_Plugins\uMarketingSuite
rmdir /s App_Plugins\uMarketingSuite.UmbracoForms
```
4. Delete the `Assets\uMarketingSuite` folder.
 
```bash
rmdir /s Assets\uMarketingSuite
 ```

5. Delete the `Partials\uMarketingSuite` folder.
  
```bash
rmdir /s Views\Partials\uMarketingSuite
```
6. Delete the existing license file in the `config\uMarketingSuite` folder.

7. Delete the existing `appsettings-schema.uMarketingSuite.json` file from the root of the project.

8. Install `Umbraco.Engage`:

```bash
dotnet add package Umbraco.Engage
```

9. Install Umbraco Engage add-on packages that were previously removed (If applicable).

```bash
dotnet add package Umbraco.Engage.Headless
dotnet add package Umbraco.Engage.Forms
dotnet add package Umbraco.Engage.Commerce
```

## Step 3: Update namespaces and entity names

Based on the [Key Changes](./#key-changes) outlined above update all uMarketingSuite references to the new Umbraco Engage alternatives. Ensure you update any Views/Partials that also reference these. This includes the different uMarketingSuite clientside scripts (like the analytics & ga4-bridge) and the Cockpit.

## Step 4: Update the database

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only proceed if all the prerequisites checks in Step 1 have passed.
{% endhint %}

In this step, you will update the database for Umbraco Engage.

1. Backup your database(s).
2. Rename the uMarketingSuite database tables, keys, constraints, and indexes using the following query:

`LINK TO Step-2-Migrate-UMS-Tables.sql file`

3. Update the Umbraco database tables to rename the following uMarketingSuite properties:
   * The `uMarketingSuite` Media folder,
   * The `uMarketingSuite` Data Types & Data Type Folder, 
   * The `uMarketingSuite` User Group Permissions,
   * The Migration State KeyValue State for `uMarketingSuite`, `uMarketingSuite.UmbracoForms`, and `uMarketingSuite.UmbracoCommerce`.

`LINK TO Step-3-Migrate-Umbraco-Data.sql file`

4. Validate that no errors occurred and all tables were updated successfully. No queries should return that 0 rows were updated.

## Step 5: Finalizing the migration

1. Delete any `obj`/`bin` folders in your projects to ensure a clean build.
2. Recompile all projects and ensure all dependencies are restored correctly.
3. Add your new Umbraco.Engage license key to the `appSettings.json` file:

```json
"Umbraco": {
  "Licenses": {
    "Umbraco.Engage": "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"
  }
}
```

4. Configure Umbraco Engage to use the legacy segment naming scheme:

```json
"Engage": {
  "Settings": {
    "UseLegacySegmentNames": true
  }
}
```


{% hint style="warning" %}

The naming scheme for segments within content variations has changed from `umarketingsuite` to `engage`.

It is required to enable the `UseLegacySegmentNames` setting on all environments to maintain compatibility with existing segments. Without it, any personalization or A/B test created using uMarketingSuite will fail to work and becomes inaccessible and incompatible with the new naming scheme.

{% endhint %}

5. (Optional) Set the `Engage:Analytics:VisitorCookie:LegacyCookieName` configuration if uMarketingSuite was using a different visitor cookie name setting than the default `uMarketingSuiteAnalyticsVisitorId`:

```json
"Engage": {
  "Analytics": {
    "VisitorCookie": {
      "LegacyCookieName": "<Your-Custom-uMarketingSuite-Visitor-Cookie>"
    }
  }
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}

Umbraco Engage will automatically convert cookies previously set by uMarketingSuite to the new cookie name. This setting is only required if you have a custom cookie name set in uMarketingSuite. It will ensure a smooth transition in tracking of existing visitors.

{% endhint %}

6. Run the project.

## Further Migrations

### uMarketingSuite.UmbracoForms

If you are using the uMarketingSuite.UmbracoForms package, all the submissions linked to visitors have been migrated using the scripts in Step 4.

Existing Forms, including those that use the uMarketingSuite-provided VisitorId field, do not require additional action.

You can install the Umbraco Engage UmbracoForms add-on package using the following command:

```bash
dotnet add package Umbraco.Engage.Forms
```

### uMarketingSuite.Headless

If you are using the uMarketingSuite.Headless package, applications that use the uMarketingSuite API will need to be updated. This needs to happen to be able to use the new Umbraco Engage API, accessible via the `/umbraco/engage/api/` routes.

The v1 Engage APIs (v13.0.0 of Umbraco Engage) maintain the same functionality as the v1 uMarketingSuite APIs.
For more details on the API, please refer to the Swagger documentation provided by Umbraco Engage.

You can install the Umbraco Engage Headless add-on package using the following command:

```bash
dotnet add package Umbraco.Engage.Headless
```

### uMarketingSuite.Commerce

If you are using the uMarketingSuite.Commerce package, all the commerce data has been migrated to Umbraco Engage using the scripts in Step 4.

You can install the Umbraco Engage Commerce addon package using the following command:

```bash
dotnet add package Umbraco.Engage.Commerce
```

### uMarketingSuite.ContentBlocks

The uMarketingSuite.ContentBlocks add-on package has been deprecated since version 2.0.0 of uMarketingSuite and is not available for Umbraco Engage.
